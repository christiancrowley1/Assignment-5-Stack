**Description:** The program prompts the user for a list of integers, when finished, user enters "A". 
The program adds these numbers to a stack using the push() method, and then sorts the stack smallest to largest.
Once this is completed the sorted stack is printed.

**How to run the program:** Once you have downloaded the program, open the terminal and navigate to where it is stored.
Then run the program by entering "java Stcks.java".

To learn more about the program, run "javadocs Stcks.java" in the terminal and navigate to the index.html file.

**Code Reusability:** The main purpose of this assignment was to show off the importance of code reusability, the majority of this code was recycled from
"Assignment-4-LinkedList", a previous assignment that I have stored in a repository. The instantiation of the data structure and methods (changed from add() to push()) 
were the primary changes made, as well as the documentation. I was able to reuse so much of the code because I used the Java Collections Framework to create and the data structures 
and add the numbers.
